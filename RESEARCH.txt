rasa nlu
https://nlu.rasa.ai/
https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu

Why might you use rasa instead of one of those services?

you don’t have to hand over your data to FB/MSFT/GOOG
you don’t have to make a https call every time.
you can tune models to work well on your particular use case.

The HTTP api exists to make it easy for non-python projects to use rasa NLU, and to make it trivial for projects currently using wit/LUIS/Dialogflow to try it out.
